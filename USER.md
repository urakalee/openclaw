# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** 老李
- **What to call them:** 老李
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** Beijing Time (UTC+8)
- **Notes:** 
  - Prefer replies directly in the channel (no threads/quote replies) unless necessary.

## Writing Style (Non-Work / Sharing)
- **Tone:** Casual, first-person storytelling ("weekend project", "finally got it working"). Avoid stiff, corporate instructional tone.
- **Context:** Include practical details (pricing, specific credits, real-world usage like "non-tech friends").
- **Formatting (WeChat):** **Do not use Markdown links** `[text](url)`. WeChat Official Accounts don't support them. Always paste the full URL explicitly (e.g., `https://example.com`) for copy-pasting.
- **Formatting (Emphasis):** Minimize bold text (`**`). It feels cluttered. Use quotes (`""`) for emphasis instead.
- **Vibe:** "Avoiding pits" (saving time), practical scenarios, playful asides.

## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
